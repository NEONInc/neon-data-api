# Welcome to the NEON Data API

## **Introduction**

The NEON Data API (Application Programming Interface) can be used to quickly access 
NEON data and information about our data products and sampling locations. 
This API provides a simple means of constructing URLs or cURL statements that 
return information in a common machine-readable format, 
[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://json.org/json-en.html). 

The API provides numerous endpoints, each delivering different types of data or 
information. Some endpoints provide the option to enter values for specific 
parameters that allow you to refine your search. If you need more information, 
try visiting our 
[FAQ](https://data.neonscience.org/faq), 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/NEONScience/neon-data-api), 
or [Using the NEON API tutorial](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-usage). 
We also provide an 
[R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html) 
that you can use to download and reformat the data.    

## **Feedback**

**Tell us what you think**: If you have design ideas, functionality requests, bug notes, 
examples of how you used the API, or anything else you would like us to know, 
please file an issue and tell us about it! This API will be enhanced as we 
receive feedback from the community.
