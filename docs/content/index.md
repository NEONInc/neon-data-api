# Welcome to the NEON Data API

## **Introduction**

The NEON Data API (Application Programming Interface) can be used to quickly access data as well as information about our data products, samples, and sampling locations. This API provides a simple means of constructing URLs or cURL statements that return information in a common machine-readable format, [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://json.org/json-en.html). 

The API provides numerous endpoints, some of which provide the option to enter values for specific parameters that allow you to refine your search. To learn more about each endpoint, click on “REST API Endpoints” in the navigation menu. To try each endpoint out, open the [REST API Explorer](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/explorer/). 

In addition to providing REST API endpoints, the NEON Data API also provides a [GraphQL](https://data.neonscience.org/data-api/graphql/) endpoint, allowing users to take advantage of the flexibility and efficiency of the [GraphQL data query language](https://graphql.org/) to access NEON metadata. The /graphql endpoint affords users the ability to define and receive only desired metadata.

* [Using the NEON API tutorial](https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-usage). 

We also provide an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/neonUtilities/index.html), called `neonUtilities`, that you can use to download and reformat the data.
