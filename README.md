# NEON Data API Docs

Welcome to NEON's data API project!

The API documentation is hosted at https://data.neonscience.org/data-api.  
The API delivers data product, site, sample, taxonomic, and location 
information in JSON format, and data in CSV format.

Please feel free to give the API a try and give us feedback via this repositoryâ€™s 
Issues section. We may not be able to accommodate all requests, but we're very 
interested in what you think the most important capabilities of a NEON API would be 
and what you would use it for. If you dive into writing a script or building an 
application, share it as an example! And of course also let us know if you run into 
any bugs or descrepancies.

## NEON-Utilities

NEON provides a set of R CRAN packages for working with the NEON data API:
